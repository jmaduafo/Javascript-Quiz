# Javascript-Quiz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The objective for this assignment was to create a Javascript quiz that allows the user to test their knowledge in Javascript. The user is scored at the very end based on how fast they are in finishing the quiz, and if they miss any question, the score is deducted by ten points. The max amount of points the user can receive is 75, and the least is 0.

This assignment helped me to improve my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. There were hurdles and multiple bugs that I ran into along the way, but throughout the assignment, I taught myself to tackle problems one thing at a time rather than trying to get everything out of the way all at once. If I couldn't solve one problem, instead of focusing all my energy on it, I'd move on to the next section and get to my main issue later. This helped me to be more productive and reduced my stress for the time-being.



## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
Example: 
![alt text](Develop/assets/images/horiseon-module1-screenshot-2.png)
## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
