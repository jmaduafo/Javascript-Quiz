# Javascript-Quiz

## Description

The objective for this assignment was to create a Javascript quiz that allows the user to test their knowledge in Javascript. The user is scored at the very end based on how fast they are in finishing the quiz, and if they miss any question, the score is deducted by ten points. The max amount of points the user can receive is 75, and the least is 0.

This assignment helped me to improve my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. There were hurdles and multiple bugs that I ran into along the way, but throughout the assignment, I taught myself to tackle problems one thing at a time rather than trying to get everything out of the way all at once. If I couldn't solve one problem, instead of focusing all my energy on it, I'd move on to the next section and get to my main issue later. This helped me to be more productive and reduced my stress for the time-being.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
